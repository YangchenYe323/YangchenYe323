💡 &nbsp; I help run compute and storage systems @The D. E. Shaw Group (prev @snowflake, @alluxio)\
🌱 &nbsp; Check out [oxc](https://github.com/web-infra-dev/oxc), an amazing javascript compiler & linter written in Rust.\
✍️ &nbsp; When I'm not working, I read systems research; play Pokemon; watch other people play Pokemon; and throw the f**ing money I earned on VTubers : )\
🫒 &nbsp; I write small tools around Bilibili's API to (hopefully) make Vtuber's lives better. \
